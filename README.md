# NEAT Flappy Bird

An AI-powered version of the classic Flappy Bird game — built using Python, Pygame, and the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Watch an AI learn to play Flappy Bird from scratch, evolving smarter birds over generations without any human input.

## Features

- Flappy Bird clone using Pygame
- AI agent trained using NEAT to play the game
- Real-time training and evolution visualization
- Saves the best performing genome for testing

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pygame
- neat-python

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To start training the AI:

```bash
python flappy_bird.py
```

To run the saved best genome (if `best.pickle` exists):

```bash
python flappy_bird.py --load-best
```

## NEAT Configuration

The file `config-feedforward.txt` contains NEAT settings such as population size, mutation rates, network structure, etc.

## How It Works

- Each bird is controlled by a neural network generated by NEAT.
- Inputs to the network:
  - Bird's vertical position
  - Distance to the next top pipe
  - Distance to the next bottom pipe
- The network outputs whether the bird should jump or not.
- A fitness function rewards birds that survive longer.
