# NEAT Flappy Bird

An AI-powered version of the classic Flappy Bird game — built using Python, Pygame, and the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Watch an AI learn to play Flappy Bird from scratch, evolving smarter birds over generations without any human input.

## Features

- Flappy Bird clone using Pygame
- AI agent trained using NEAT to play the game
- Real-time training and evolution visualization
- Saves the best performing genome for testing

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pygame
- neat-python

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To start training the AI:

```bash
python flappy_bird.py
```

To run the saved best genome (if `best.pickle` exists):

```bash
python flappy_bird.py --load-best
```

## NEAT Configuration

The file `config-feedforward.txt` contains NEAT settings such as population size, mutation rates, network structure, etc.

## How It Works

- Each bird is controlled by a neural network generated by NEAT.
- Inputs to the network:
  - Bird's vertical position
  - Distance to the next top pipe
  - Distance to the next bottom pipe
- The network outputs whether the bird should jump or not.
- A fitness function rewards birds that survive longer.

- Pygame Setup for rendering and events
- Game Objects (OOP) like Bird, Pipe, and Floor
- Game Configuration for adjusting gameplay
- Game Logic for collisions, scoring, and the main loop

It's clean, color-coded, and ideal for organizing development or explaining your codebase.

## Collision Detection in Flappy Bird
In Flappy Bird, detecting when the bird crashes into a pipe or hits the ground is crucial to ending the game. There are two main ways to handle this in Pygame:

1. Rectangle Collision Detection
This uses bounding rectangles to check for overlap:

```bird_rect.colliderect(pipe_rect)```

- Fast and simple, but may detect a collision even when pixels don’t truly overlap.
- Useful for rough hitbox-based games.

2. Pixel Perfect Collision Detection
This checks actual non-transparent pixels using masks:

```bird_mask.overlap(pipe_mask, offset)```

- More accurate: Only detects collisions when visible pixels touch.
- Recommended for games with irregular-shaped sprites like Flappy Bird.

Edge Collisions
A collision also occurs if the bird touches the top of the screen or the ground.
